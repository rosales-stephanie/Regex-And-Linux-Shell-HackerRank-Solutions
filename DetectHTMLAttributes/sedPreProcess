sed -n '
#was used to avoid sorting tags along with their attriutes
s/\^Z//
#get rid of last comma
s/,$//
#Note: If you put a p, only at the end of this command, nothing would ever get
# printed ex. ^Zli:id,^Za:accesskey,href,title,^Zul: 
#tag:^Ztag 
s/:\^Z/:\n/g
#Note: If none of the tags had attributes and this command was the only print 
#statement, nothing would ever get printed as well
#attribute,^Ztag
s/,\^Z/\n/g
#Thus avoid using p at the end of commands and just print everything at the end
